# validation-rules
Validation rules for every occasion

MDK-1/4/19: Initial Entry

I've built this repository so that known good validation rules can be available, well documented, and deployable.  I can also branch a rule for whatever purpose I want and use it for other purposes without altering the original rule.

This is a public repository, so I plan on making this available to anyone that had a need to access this.  At this point I still don't know enough about Git and Github to determine whether I can build sub-repositories.  I consider this an experiment in that.

Eventually, this will expand to Triggers, their unit tests, and code.  The new Salesforce DX is supposed to allow for the reuse of Metadata (Process Builder, Flows, and other automation that can be stored, reused, and redeployed in other Salesforce Orgs I am hoping.  DX is smoking new, and I'm still learning about it.
